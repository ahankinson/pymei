PyMEI is being deprecated.

You can still find the last version of it in the "archive" branch, but it is no longer being maintained.

LibMEI is the new hotness, but don't worry: You don't have to write awful icky C++. We've got shiny Python bindings for it, with instructions on how to build them available on the LibMEI wiki: https://github.com/DDMAL/libmei/wiki

All features of PyMEI have been ported over to LibMEI, so they are pretty much the same now. If there is something missing, please feel free to send a berating e-mail to andrew.hankinson@mail.mcgill.ca.
